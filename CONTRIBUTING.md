## How to contribute

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and instead email <mike@the100.io> directly.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/mlapeter/the100reactapp/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/mlapeter/the100reactapp/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in our [Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/vVzvaJv) and tag @muhuhuhaha and start writing code. Also add it to the suggestions column on our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/invite/b/4Mwsb4kz/2f1160cb81c1c88ed95de84e9aa5fe0a/the100io-app-alpha-feedback).

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Code Style**

* Please use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to keep code style consistent. For Prettier settings, use double quotes, bracket spacing, semicolons at end of line, the default print width of 80, and a tab width of 2 spaces.


#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Hop in our [Discord Chat](https://discord.gg/vVzvaJv), where you can ask any of the developers there.
